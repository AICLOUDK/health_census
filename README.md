This website is about  users view and manage health information related to common conditions like thyroid, diabetes, and blood pressure. Users can input their personal data such as name, gender, age, and health condition, and the site will generate statistical summaries showing how many people have each condition and their distribution between genders.  

It also allows users to search for specific health conditions to see detailed information, including symptoms, prevention tips, and treatment options, along with relevant images. Additionally, there is a contact form for users to send messages or ask questions. This project demonstrates how to build an interactive web page that collects data, displays analysis, and retrieves detailed health information dynamically.
